🚀 Student Details Form using HTML, CSS & JavaScript 📋💻

I created a responsive Student Form Application that collects basic student information through a clean and user-friendly interface. Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, this project allows users to:

✅ Add and store student details
🗑️ Delete entries from the list
🎨 Includes a simple and intuitive UI for smooth user experience

This project helped me strengthen my skills in DOM manipulation, form handling, and data rendering without any external libraries.

🔧 Tech Used:

1.HTML for structure

2.CSS for styling

3.JavaScript for interactivity
